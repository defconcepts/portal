			<p>The <strong>Portal</strong> greatly simplifies things essential to real-time web applications like connection sharing, reply, heartbeat and disconnection detection. The <strong>Portal</strong> is designed by carefully considering known issues and best practices of real-time web to provide a reliable socket based on its simple protocol.</p>
